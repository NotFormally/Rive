# Rive - Reddit Targeted Strategy & Calendar

This document replaces the previous one-size-fits-all approach. Reddit communities instantly spot generic SaaS posts. To succeed, we must speak their exact language, complain about their specific problems, and mention our tool as an afterthought that solves that exact problem.

Here are 5 hyper-tailored, minimalist, and authentic posts for 5 different communities. The plan is to deploy **one post per day**.

---

### Day 1: r/BarOwners
**Focus:** Pour cost variance, liquid inventory, POS matching.
**Tone:** Frustrated owner talking to other owners about "paper vs. liquid".

**Title:** Anyone else's POS variance not matching their physical keg counts?

**Body:**
> We were bleeding margin on liquids for months. The POS numbers looked fine on paper, but our actual keg yields and liquor bottle counts were always way off at the end of the week. Real pour cost was way higher than paper pour cost.
> 
> We finally stopped using messy spreadsheets and started tracking theoretical vs. actual variance down to the ounce, and separated our glass/keg deposits from the true cost.
> 
> My team and I actually ended up building a small app to automate this for our own spot. It syncs with Toast/Square to catch variances instantly without fighting Excel every Sunday morning. If anyone is dealing with this right now and wants to see how we set it up, you can check it out here: https://www.rivehub.com
> 
> How are you guys currently tracking your true pour variance?

### Day 2: r/Restaurant_Managers
**Focus:** Shift handovers, BOH/FOH communication, staff accountability.
**Tone:** A relieved GM sharing a management win.

**Title:** Getting AM and PM shifts to actually communicate.

**Body:**
> The biggest headache I had as a GM was the lack of communication between shifts. Half the time, prep was left out or a fridge was running warm, and it wasn't reported until the next day. It led to so much unnecessary spoilage and stress between the day team and night team.
> 
> We finally ditched the physical logbook and the chaotic WhatsApp groups. We digitized our daily logs so every equipment issue and staff handover is tracked, searchable, and actually actionable.
> 
> We couldn't find a simple, intuitive tool for this, so we built our own. It even translates notes instantly if your kitchen staff speaks different native languages. If you're looking for a better way to handle shift notes, you can check out what we built here: https://www.rivehub.com

> What systems are you guys currently using for shift communication?

### Day 3: r/restaurateur
**Focus:** Menu engineering, shrinking the menu, raising profits without raising prices.
**Tone:** Strategic owner sharing business results.

**Title:** We cut 20% of our menu items and profits actually went up.

**Body:**
> With inflation right now, we didn't want to raise prices again and scare off regulars. Instead, we pulled all our POS data and mapped every dish by popularity and true profit margin.
> 
> We ruthlessly cut the items that required unique prep but didn't actually make us money. Spoilage dropped overnight, inventory got simpler, and the kitchen started moving way faster.
> 
> The hardest part was matching the raw POS exports with the constantly fluctuating invoice prices from suppliers to get the actual margin. We ended up building a tool that automates this exact matrix (syncs with POS, scans invoices).

> 
> Has anyone else had success shrinking their menu recently?

### Day 4: r/KitchenConfidential
**Focus:** Breakdowns in kitchen communication, language barriers, recipe execution.
**Tone:** A Chef/BOH leader solving line cook chaos.

**Title:** Breaking the language barrier on the line.

**Body:**
> One of the biggest issues we had with mistakes on prep lists and station setups was the language barrier. We had English speaking managers, Spanish speaking line cooks, and Bengali dishwashers. Important notes were getting lost in translation constantly.
> 
> We started automatically translating all our recipe cards, hygiene logs, and daily prep lists into everyone's native language. The difference in execution and compliance was night and day. Mistakes dropped to almost zero because everyone finally understood the exact instructions without relying on a bilingual teammate.
> 
> We actually built a simple app to do this for our kitchen (it translates 14 languages instantly for service notes and prep). If anyone is managing a multilingual kitchen and wants to see it, here's the link: https://www.rivehub.com
> 
> How do you guys handle communication breakdowns when there's a strong language barrier?

### Day 5: r/restaurant
**Focus:** General struggle with catching stealth inflation and saving time on admin.
**Tone:** Tired operator sharing a time-saving hack.

**Title:** Dealing with "invisible inflation" from suppliers.

**Body:**
> For a long time, we couldn't figure out why our food cost was drifting up even though our menu mix was the exact same. Turns out our suppliers were bumping prices on high-volume items (frying oil, bulk proteins, dairy) by mere pennies every few deliveries. 
> 
> We stopped tracking average costs and started tracking ingredient-level variance week-over-week. We had to digitize all our delivery receipts to actually catch the stealth price creep.
> 
> To save time, we built a small app for our own spot that reads invoices and flags supplier price jumps instantly. We're sharing it now to see if it helps others fighting the same battle. You can check it out here if you're interested: https://www.rivehub.com
> 
> How are you all keeping track of stealth price hikes from your reps?
