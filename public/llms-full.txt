## Feature Deep Dive

### 1. AI-Powered Logbook ("The Captain's Log")
A digital logbook where staff log shift handovers, equipment issues, and service incidents. The AI engine:

- Extracts keywords, detects urgency levels, and categorizes entries
- Automatically creates follow-up tasks (e.g., "Call the plumber" from a note about a leaking fridge)
- Provides AI-generated summaries of each entry
- Supports translation so notes written in Spanish are readable in Bengali

### 2. HACCP Compliance Assistant & Corrective Actions
Monitors temperature logs and operational data to maintain food safety compliance:
- Detects temperature anomalies (e.g., meat fridge rising to 8°C)
- Suggests specific corrective actions: "Isolate or discard high-risk food", "Check compressor"
- Documents HACCP procedures for health inspections
- Automatic reminders for routine checks (fryer oil, expiry dates)
